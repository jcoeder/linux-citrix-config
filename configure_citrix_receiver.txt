# Run:
sudo rm -f /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/npwrapper.npica.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/npwrapper.npica.so
sudo rm -f /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/npica.so
sudo ln -s /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/npica.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/npica.so


# 8. Configure Firefox
#  In Firefox, go to Tools -> Add-ons -> Plugins
#  and make sure the "Citrix Receiver for Linux" plugin is set to "Always Activate".
#
#  Starting in Firefox 32, plugins are set to "Ask to Activate" by default,
#  but for some reason the activation prompt is never displayed for the
#  Citrix Receiver plugin, so the plugin will not work unless it is set to
#  "Always Activate".

# 9. Configure Chrome/Chromium
# To use Citrix Receiver in Chrome and/or Chromium, run:
xdg-mime default wfica.desktop application/x-ica
